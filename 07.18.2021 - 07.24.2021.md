### Journal Entry: 07.19.2021
* I worked in python to send an email to the user after a process was completed
  * This involved creating a template in HTML and Javascript that the email could follow
* I also made sure to send a success message to the user once the button was clicked that stated that an email would be sent once the process was finished
  * I made sure that this success-alert was dismissible as I had just worked on that within the past couple weeks so it was fresh in my mind
* The email message also required that I did an HttpResponseRedirect with the alert message
  * This was also fresh in my mind so it was pretty simple to implement

* Gained more experience creating merge requests and watching code run through linters and pipelines
  * When my pipeline failed, I was able to diagnose that the server was down so I could retry once it was back up
* Looked into what a lambda function might look like and how we might implement one within our code base
* Worked on commiting code for a big project that I was working on
  * I made sure that my comments made sense and that I referenced all relevant files
