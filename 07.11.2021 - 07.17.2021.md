### Journal Entry: 07.15.2021
* I gained more experience working with Django migrations. I was working on fixing my database.
  * I tried to get a dump from my production database and it was messing a few things up because I had more fields in my local environment than the prod environment so when I went to merge, there were unknown fields
  * I was able to figure out some django migration commands that fixed the problem but it took me a while. 
  * I just had to fix this a couple weeks ago and forgot what the proper order was so I decided to make a gist in case I needed to do it again
  * https://gist.github.com/Emmet-Pritchard/c308aa3e3f398ff60be2b47eb9a47243
* A user wanted an api that returned some different information so I worked on adding an extension to an existing api
  * I was able to do a little bit of research about building a djangoREST api and figure out where I needed to search in the code base
  * It was necessary for me to understand serializers in order to properly authenticate users using tokens and permissions
  * I had to create the api as a view, change the url, and add it to the master url that I wanted it attached to
