  * Thought of plenty of specific questions about performance over the past quarter
* Research solutions to separating a long function from the main AWS service and timing out
  * I want to run a script that does a lot of data manipulation and then sends the desired CSV file to the user
  * AWS has a service called Lambda that is a good candidate for a job like this as it will only be billed when used
