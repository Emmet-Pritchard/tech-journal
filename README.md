## Tech Journal

The purpose of this journal is to document the daily/weekly tasks that I have completed. This will better allow me to recap my progress as a programmer. I think that this journal will be especially important while I am still in my internship as well as school. It will help me build a resume and a social profile (LinkedIn) that accurately reflects the work that I am doing. I chose to add tags to the bottom of the entries in order to better show myself what technologies I am frequently learning. It could also provide a fast way to search topics within my journals.
