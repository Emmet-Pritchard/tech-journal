## Tech Journal

The purpose of this journal is to document the daily/weekly tasks that I have completed. This will better allow me to recap my progress as a programmer. I think that this journal will be especially important while I am still in my internship as well as school. It will help me build a resume and a social profile that accurately reflects the work that I am doing. I like the idea of adding tags at the bottom of the entries in order to offer quick searches of various tech topics. 

## For Example

### Journal Entry: 07.09.2021
* Created HttpResponseRedirect with a detailed alert message
* Fixed the dismissible feature for the pop-up alert in bootstrap
* Verified that the data populating the 'Automatic Repair Classification CSV' was accurate
